            <h2>Past</h2>
            <p>I have a bland and basically ordinary backstory. I was born and raised in San Jose,California with two older brothers,a chocolate labrador retreiver, and of course my parents. I didn't really have any interests until middle school which was martial arts and technology. I did go to various schools but the most significant ones would have to be Most holy Trinity school and Norwood Elementary School.
        <h2>Present </h2>
        <p>I am currently a founding student at Alpha Cindy Avitia High School, with the dream to graduate to the best of my abilities. In my spare time when I am not studying or finishing homework, I like to attend my tae kwon do class, write short stories, or simply relax with music,games or TV. I am also attempting to learn how to play violin, and also to speak, read, and hopefully even write in Japanese, German, and French. My biggest career goal is to be an inventor like Ben Franklin was in his time, specificly devices that contribute to biology or technology. This is why my most engaged academics are biology and computer science in school.
